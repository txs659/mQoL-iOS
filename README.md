**To run the code in a simulator:**
1. Clone repo
2. Open `mQoL Lab.xcworkspace` with `Xcode` - this will load the project with the installed CacaoPods
3. Make sure that a simulator is selected in the upper left corner.
4. Press `Run` or use `Cmd + R`
5. Be patient - the simulator can take several minutes to run the first time.


**To run on a real device:**
1. Clone repo
2. Open `mQoL Lab.xcworkspace` with `Xcode` - this will load the project with the installed CacaoPods
3. Connect an iPhone to your MacBook
4. Make sure that your device name is selected in the upper left corner.
5. Press `Run` or use `Cmd + R`
6. There is a chance that Xcode complains about missing permissions. But Xcode will instruct you how to solve this (you need to accept the app in your real device's settings).
